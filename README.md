# path-visualization
Simple project using Django to visual path between two points using DSA Algorithms.\
👨‍💻 By : https://github.com/Aaru1007 🗿

<br>

**🔍 In this Project i used two type of shortest path algos : 🔍**\
1> Dijkstra algorithm\
2> A-star algorithm (A*)

<br>

**▶ It have some buttons like : ▶**\
1> Start point (for selection of starting point)🟢\
2> End point (for selection of ending point)🔴\
3> Generate random grid ( for ignore several of grid in visualization)🎲\
4> Erasing/Drawing (Erase - for erase unwanted selection of grid & Drawing - To select the grid in our way)🖌\
5> selected Algo (for which algorithm we wants to use)❓\
6> reset (for reset all the data)🔄\
7> submit (for showing visualization)✅

<br>

**⚠ How to use? ⚠**\
1> open new terminal (Ctrl + `)\
2> make sure you're in "PathVisualization-main" directory\
3> python manage.py runserver

<br>
